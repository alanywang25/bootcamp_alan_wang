## Data Storage

### Folder Structure
- `data/raw/`: Contains immutable input data in its original form (CSV format)
- `data/processed/`: Contains cleaned and processed data in Parquet format for efficient analysis

### Formats
- **CSV**: Used for raw data as it's human-readable and universally supported
- **Parquet**: Used for processed data as it's compressed and preserves data types

### Environment Variables
Paths are configured via `.env.example` file:

## Homework Folder Rules
- Each homework will be in its own subfolder (`homework0`, `homework1`, etc.)
- Include all required files for grading.
## Project Folder Rules
- Keep project files organized and clearly named.
