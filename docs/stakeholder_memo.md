## Stakeholder & User

The primary stakeholders of this project would be portfolio managers and algorithmic traders, and students who are studying financial engineering or quantitative finance could be users. The model predictions from this project can be used for market pre-screenings, and the model outputs can be useful in informing buy/sell/hold decisions in a simulated environment.

## Assumptions & Constraints

- Data used for this project will be limited to free data sources such as Yahoo Finance or Bloomberg, and only to daily/weekly data. 

- The machine learning models will only be run on my local machine

- There won't be any analysis of real-time data (latency constraint)

- There won't be any actual trading being done with these model outputs (compliance constraint).
